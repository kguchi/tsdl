# TSDL training
This is a java training project for the new employees in TSDL.

## What it does
In this project, we provide a function which reads a file content and displays all the lines of that file in reverse order. For now, user chooses a file from the file list (`./file`) and then the output is displayed on terminal. In future, we may build UI instead of executing on terminal.

- OS: Linux & MacOS
- Java 1.8

## Supported file format
- file extension: `.txt` `.csv` `.log`
- encoding: UTF-8
- maximum size: 50MB
- newline code: LF, CRLF

## How to run
- Compile : `./scripts/compile.sh`
- Run : `./scripts/run.sh`
